/**
When using Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct model, I have met below error print to indicate a memory issue
"
torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 1.02 GiB.
GPU 0 has a total capacity of 8.00 GiB of which 0 bytes is free.
Of the allocated memory 14.23 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 129.36 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated.
If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
